Just remember on some dark and stormy night, when the thunder is crashin and the pillars of earth are shaking.. When some wild-eyed, eight-foot-tall maniac grabs your neck, taps the back of your head up against the barroom wall, looks you crooked in the eye, and asks you if you paid your dues; you just stare that big sucker right back in the eye, and you remember what ol' Zach Stevens always says at a time like that: "Have you paid your dues, Zach?" Yes, sir, the check is in the mail.
