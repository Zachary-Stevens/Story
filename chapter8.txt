The night was dark, cold and wet. Strong gusts blew across the pourch while the chimes sang in the wind. A roar echoed across the house as the thunder shook the bed. "This is a bad storm tonight I wonder if the power will go out." And just like magic darkness spread across the neighborhood. The power had vanished like a light switch had been turned off. Suddenly it had turned back on but only it the power hadn't returned in my house. It wasn't back on with the outside street lights. It was more of an ominous white light from the back of the house. I jumped out of my bed to see who had their power turned back on. As I approached the window I began to notice that the light wasn't coming from any house, it was directly beamed down to my backyard. I got to the window and looked up for the source of the bright light when to my disarray - what looked to be a flying ship was on the horizon. Like an alien ship but not just any alien ship, it was more like The Avengers ships that I saw the 5 years ago when everyone dissapeared. Asgardians were their name, the Asgardians of the Galaxy where here.
Before I can continue with my story, we're going to have to go back 6 days ago during a time that until recently I thought to be impossible. It all started by doing a little hazing against some stupid gamer named Thor on a game called Fortnite.
