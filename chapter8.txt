The night was dark, cold and wet. Strong gusts blew across the pouch while the chimes sang in the wind. A loud roar echoed across the house as the thunder shook bed. "This is a bad storm tonight I wonder if the power will go out." And just like magic darkness spread across the neighborhood. The power had vanished like a light switch had been turned off. There suddenly it had turned on but only it wasn't on in the house. It wasn't on in the street lights. It was more of an ominous white light from the back of the house. I jumped out of my bed to see who had their power turned back on. As I approached the window I began to notice that the light wasn't coming from any house, it was directly beamed down to my backyard. I got to the window and looked up for the source of the bright light when to my disarray - Aliens where on the horizon. Not just any aliens. Azgardians, the Azgardians of the Galaxy where here.
Before I can continue with my story, we're going to have to go back 6 months ago during a time that until recently I thought to be impossible and it all started with a little hazing on a game called Fortnite.
